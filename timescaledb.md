Timescale DB
============

TimescaleDB inherits all of PostgresSQL; what works in psql works in timescale

#### Create hypertable -

> When you create a hypertable, it is automatically partitioned on the time column you provide as the second parameter to create_hypertable().
>
> Also, TimescaleDB automatically creates an index on the time column.

#### Manually call a refresh policy -
> CALL refresh_continuous_aggregate(
 'stock_candlestick_daily',
 now() - INTERVAL '1 week',
 now()
 );


> Use this SQL command to create an auto-updating policy for the continuous aggregate stock_candlestick_daily:
> 
>> SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('stock_candlestick_daily',
  start_offset => INTERVAL '3 days',
  end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
  schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 days');
>>
>> * This policy runs once a day, as set by "schedule_interval".
>> 
>> * When it runs, it materializes data from between 3 days ago and 1 hour ago,
>> 
>> as set by "start_offset" and "end_offset".
>> * Offset times are calculated relative to query execution time. The executed query is the one defined in the continuous aggregate stock_candlestick_daily.
