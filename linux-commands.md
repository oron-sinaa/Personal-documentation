### ">" operator:

">" redirects output to a file (but it can be to a device).
">>" to append.

If number is not specified, the standard output stream is assumed, but you can also redirect errors:

"> file"  - redirects *stdout* to file

"1> file" - redirects *stdout* to file

"2> file" - redirects *stderr* to file

"&> file" - redirects *stdout* and stderr to file

"> file 2>&1" - redirects *stdout and stderr* to file

"/dev/null" is the null device it takes any input you want and throws it away. It can be used to suppress any output.

Note: "> file 2>&1" is an older syntax which still works, &> file is neater, but would not have worked on older systems.
